##### Burst Time

Process Execution Time

##### Turn Around Time

Completion Time - Arrival Time

##### Waiting Time

Turn Around Time - Bust Time

##### Average Waiting Time

$\sum$ Waiting Time / Number of Processes

##### Priority Numbers

Based on these numbers, the algorithm prioritises processes

*The lowest the number the higher the priority*

*The highest the number the lowest the priority*

## Types

### Non-Preemptive

> These algorithms have no control over the preemption of the process, thus the next process can only come when the previous one is done completing its bust time

#### SJF - Shortest Job First

### Preemptive

#### SRTF - Shortest Remaining Time First

* Preemptive version of SJF - Shortest Job First
* Preempt the CPU based on the shortest time required by a process

#### RR - Round Robin

* Provide equal Time Quantum to all processes
* A queue is maintained where processes waiting are put one after another

  * The next processes is picked from the top of the queue

##### Time Quantum

The CPU time which is to be assigned to each processes

##### Example Time Quantum = 2

#### Multi Level Queue Scheduling

* Multiple Queues are maintained with each Queue having a Priority
* Each Queue may represent a process, such as System Processes, Interactive Processes, Student Processes etc.
* Lower priority queues will only be executed until the higher priority queues are not empty
* If lower priority queue process is executing and within that time a higher priority queue process arrives then the lower priority queue process is preempted and higher priority process is executed first.

#### Multi Level Feedback Queue

* Initially all processes belong to the first queue
* Shift the processes to below queues if they are not bursted within the current queue
* Last queue always have FCFS
