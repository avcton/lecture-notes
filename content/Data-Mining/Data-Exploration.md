* Summarisation\
  *Start by determining basic insights about the data*

  * Mean

    * Avoided when large outliers are present in the data
  * Median
  * Mode
  * IQR
  * Standard Deviation
  * Class Imbalance

    * If one class dominates or a specific class has a low count
* Visualisation\
  *Select a subset of data and choose an appropriate graph to visualise it*

  * Histograms

    * For Numerical Data
  * Bar Charts

    * For Categorical Data
  * Scatter Plots

    * To determine correlation and outliers
  * Line Plots

    * Connected relation between data
  * Box Plots

    * To determine the distribution, outliers and quartiles of a numerical dimensions
  * Contour Plots

    * Used for temporal Data
  * Correlation Matrix
