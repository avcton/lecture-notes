> The process of acquiring, fetching and collecting data.

## Sources

There can be multiple sources acquire data from, such as:

* Surveys / Interviews
* Online Repositories
* Commercial Databases

## Requirements

* Large Volumes of Data

  * Large volumes of data help us with understanding complex patterns
* Clean and Pure Data

  * Though it is highly unlikely but clean data is our preference since it can save a lot of preprocessing time
