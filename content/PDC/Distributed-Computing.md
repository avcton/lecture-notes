In a nutshell, independent machines connected together

> A collection of <span class="text-highlight">autonomous computers</span> connected together through a network and distribution middleware make up a <span class="text-highlight">distribution system</span>
>
> Distributed Computing splits a large and complex processing task into smaller subparts and process these parts in parallel utilising the power of distributed systems

* Perceived as an integrated system with an atomic central memory<sup>(Share the same memory)</sup>
* A middleware acts as a controller or master / sort of an operating system that coordinates the tasks and results of connected machines
* Computers may share logical memory but physical memory is not shared
* Clusters of Computers are stablished and they work together as a single unit

  * A Cluster consists of multiple computers working together
* The clusters of autonomous computers reside geographically on different locations and are connected through different network topologies
* Implemented using the MPI Paradigm
