## Research Papers

* [Mobile Cloud Computing - A Survey, State of Art and Future Directions.pdf](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf)
* Need of MCC

  * [limitations at the mobile device end (e.g., computation and storage capacity, energy, shared wireless medium) significantly impede further improvements in application quality of service (QoS)- typical measures of QoS include user experienced delay, service reliability/availability and information privacy.](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=1)
  * [Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) aims to overcome these limitations by integrating cloud computing into the mobile environment to enable mobile users and mobile application providers to elastically utilize resources in an on-demand fashion.](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=1)
  * [ The main goal is to provide a better experience for mobile users whose devices have limited resources and capacities like computation, storage and battery](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=2)
  * [According to a recent study from Heavy Reading \[9\] the direct revenue of mobile cloud market will grow to about $68 billion by 2017. It is expected to achieve $1 trillion for the broader mobile cloud market.](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=1)
* Definition of MCC

  * [Given the current commercial hype and the fact that there are diverse ways of cooperating cloud computing and mobile applications, it is not surprising that there is no single widely accepted clear definition of MCC, as a result its scope can not be properly defined \[1\]. ](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=1)
  * [we refer to MCC as the set of techniques that use cloud resources to empower mobile applications](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=2)
  * [Mobile Cloud computing at its simplest refers to an infrastructure where both the data storage and the data processing happen outside of the mobile device. Mobile cloud applications move the computing power and data storage away from mobile phones and into the cloud, bringing applications and mobile computing to not just smart phone users but a much broader range of mobile subscribers](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20Implications%20and%20Challenges-20240302162916-wtysjmj.pdf#page=6)
* Definition of Cloud Computing

  * [Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices as a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network(typically the Internet). It provides computation, software, and storage services that do not require end-user knowledge of the physical location and system configuration.](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=2)
* Applications

  * Mobile Learning

    * Challenges

      * Quick depletion of device energy when streaming videos
      * Not every part of a lecture needs to delivered using high quality video
      * Security and privacy of confidential interchanges are critical especially when testing and exams are online
  * Mobile Commerce (m-commerce)

    * Challenges

      * Secure Payment Gateways
      * Private Interactions between User and Provider
      * Techniques to structure where and how content is stored and released (public cloud vs. private cloud vs. mobile device)
  * Mobile healthcare and wellness (m-healthcare)

    * Challenges

      * Real time processing and storing of huge volumes of patient data
      * Privacy and Security of medical information
* Challenges

  * [What to offload and when to offload](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=6)
  * [Much of the recent research focuses on making dynamic offloading decisions at runtime \[39, 43, 54\]rather than statically \[55, 57\] partitioning tasks based on past profiles](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=6)
  * [Open research issues](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=7)

  * [Location privacy is akey issue in mobile services that use location, i.e. location based services (LBS) \[56\]. Two popular techniques for location privacy are spatial/temporal cloaking and domain transformation](assets/Mobile%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20A%20Survey,%20State%20of%20Art%20and%20Future%20Directions-20240302162916-7n331i9.pdf#page=8)
