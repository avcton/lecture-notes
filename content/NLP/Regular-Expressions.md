> A regex is a string of text that lets you create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text.

Regex can be used any time you need to query string-based data, such as:

* Analysing command line output
* Parsing user input
* Examining server or program logs
* Handling text files with a consistent syntax, like a CSV
* Reading configuration files
* Searching and refactoring code

While doing all of these is *theoretically* possible without regex, <span class="text-highlight">when regexes hit the scene they act as a superpower</span> for doing all of these tasks.

## Errors

### Type 1 Errors

* False Positives

  * Words which exist but should not be in the result

### Type 2 Errors

* False Negatives

  * The words which are left out but were actually supposed to be in the result
